    <h1>Rigatoni al Segreto</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can San Marzano tomatoes, blended smooth</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package uncooked rigatoni pasta</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons cold butter</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmigiano cheese</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and salt.
        Cook until no longer white and starting to turn translucent, about 5
        minutes. Stir in garlic; cook about 1 minute. Add red pepper flakes,
        then blended tomatoes with water. Bring to a simmer; adjust heat to
        medium or medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 45 to 60
        minutes. Reduce heat to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 8 minutes (5 minutes from doneness).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add about 2/3 of the basil to the sauce. Stir in butter. When butter
        melts, add cheese in 3 increments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain pasta; transfer to sauce. Stir until rigatoni are evenly coated
        with sauce. Serve sprinkled with the remaining basil and a dusting of
        grated cheese.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enjoy!!</p>
